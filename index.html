            <p class="news-description">SC East Bengal (SCEB) failed to make use of a numerical advantage to settle for a 1-1 draw against FC Goa in their reverse leg Indian Super League clash at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, here on Friday.

Spanish centre forward Igor Angulo (39th minute) rounded off Debjit Majumder after being left unmarked to give the Gaurs a first-half lead.

            <p class="news-description">Such is the quality of the Indian batting line up that England bowlers will need to bowl their best balls repeatedly if they want to put the hosts, led by their peerless skipper Virat Kohli, under any kind of pressure during the upcoming Test series, reckons batting coach Graham Thorpe.

Since his horrendous show in an away series in England in 2014, Kohli has demolished England attack both at home (2016) and away (2018) although the team had contrasting results in both series.
 Virat is in one of that batting orders which understands home conditions very well.”

            <p class="news-description">She thought herself to be worthy of it but veteran long distance runner Sudha Singh was nonetheless surprised when her name figured in this year’ Padma Shri award winners’ list.

The 34-year-old from Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh joined an elite list of track-and-field Padma winners comprising the likes of Milkha Singh, Anju Bobby George and P T Usha among others. She was nominated for this year’s award by the Uttar Pradesh government.
